# polscan

<Trying to make this portable
Not sure if I'll succeed. Use upstream version if you run debian or get ready for a lot of pain>


*polscan* (short for "Policy Scanner") 
* Makes your DevOps server configuration/security/automation policies explicit
* Easily detects configuration drift (Puppet)
* Provides details on package updates (Debian, PHP, Gem)
* Provides basic security checks
* Explains policies
  * by linking references
  * referencing to security standards
  * by having reasonable descriptions
* Has zero setup, no dependencies: Bash 4.2, SSH

Policies are implemented by [small shell snippets](http://lzone.de/polscan/) and thus polscan is easily extensible by your own specific policies. To make it easy to use it comes with host discovery solutions for typical automation setups (Chef, Puppet, MCollective).

Note: polscan is intentionally limited to Debian and for simplicity tries not to implement any distro-specific dependencies.

How to run it
-------------

polscan keeps results on a daily basis so it makes sense to set up a daily cron.

Or just run it from the source directory

    ./polscan                          # To re-scan all hosts
    ./polscan -l 'server1 server2'     # To scan specific hosts

Access Results
--------------

For simplicity all results are store in files in plain text and JSON. The JSON files are used by the static HTML viewer that can be used to inspect the result archive.

To quickly expose the static results in any webservers document root run the following commands from the directory you installed polscan into:

    cp -r www /var/www/polscan
    mkdir /var/www/polscan/results
    ln -s /var/www/polscan/results results
